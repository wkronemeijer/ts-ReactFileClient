All those StringEnums are cool, but frankly it also kind of sucks. How do we get maximum value from categorization, with minimal effort?

Also notice that there are a number of functional dependencies



Most BN can be divided by the 6 elements

Most waves consists of 6 sets, 1 of each element
    (Exception is Phantoka and Mistika)

HF does not have elements, but it does have the colors

small, medium, large single figure sets
playsets (lol)
ammo, collectibles
figure with vehicle
multi-character (Karzahni comes to mind)

interface idea: 
top-left select which kinds of set to view
top-right shows distribution of elements (standard and special)
